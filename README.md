# CGPA Calculator & Course Planner

This is a web-based CGPA calculator and course planning tool made to help students keep track of their academic progress and plan upcoming semesters more clearly. The project is built using course and credit data taken from an Excel sheet, so the calculations closely follow how CGPA is actually computed in universities.

The website allows students to enter the grades they have received for completed courses and automatically calculates the CGPA using a credit-weighted average. Along with this, it provides a course planner where students can organize courses semester-wise and get an idea of how their future grades may affect their overall CGPA.

The main aim of this project is to make CGPA calculation and semester planning simpler and more structured, instead of relying on manual calculations or scattered spreadsheets. It is intended to be easy to use and practical for everyday academic planning.

## Features
- CGPA calculation based on course credits and grades  
- Semester-wise course planning  
- Estimation of CGPA after future semesters  
- Course and credit data mapped from an Excel sheet  
- Simple and student-friendly interface  

## Use Case
This tool is useful for students who want to:
- Check their current CGPA accurately  
- Plan future semesters in advance  
- Understand how different grade outcomes impact their CGPA  

The project can be easily adapted for different universities or departments by updating the course and credit information in the Excel file.

## Future Scope
- Support for multiple grading systems  
- User accounts to save academic progress  
- Visual graphs for CGPA trends  
- Exporting results as PDF or Excel
